	This class evaluates a set found communities against a ground truth cover. Each found community
	is compared against the communities of the seed node in the ground truth cover.

	For each score, the ground truth community is chosen as comparison that maximizes the score.
	If seeds are not ignored (a parameter of the constructor), then only ground truth communities
	that contain the given seed are used to compare against.

	The calculated scores are:

	Precision: the size of the intersection of found and ground truth community divided by the
	size of the found community, i.e., how much of the found community was an actual match.

	Recall: the size of the intersection of found and ground truth community divided by the
	size of the ground truth community, i.e., how much of the ground truth community was found.

	F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

	Jaccard index: the size of the intersection of found and ground truth community divided by the
	size of the union of found and ground truth community.

	For each score, the range of values is between 0 and 1, where 0 is the worst and 1 the best score.
